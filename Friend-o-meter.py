# Time Complexity:
# Building the graph takes O(V + E), where V is the number of tasks and E is the number of dependencies.
# topological sorting step takes O(V + E), as we process each task and edge exactly once.
# Calculate Earliest Start Time (EST) and Earliest Finish Time (EFT) step takes O(V + E) since we're iterating over each task and its dependencies.
# Calculate Latest Finish Time (LFT) and Latest Start Time (LST) step also takes O(V + E) for the same reasons as the EST/EFT calculation.
# Return Results is O(V) since weâ€™re iterating over the tasks to get these values.
# Time Complexity Summary

# Space Complexity:
# The space complexity is dominated by the adjacency list (graph), which is O(V + E), along with the space for the dictionaries. Thus, the overall space complexity is O(V + E).
